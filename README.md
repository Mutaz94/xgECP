The xgxr package supports a structured approach for exploring PKPD data ([outlined at the xGx website](http://opensource.nibr.com/xgx)).  It also contains helper functions for enabling the modeler to follow best R practices (by appending the program name, figure name location, and draft status to each plot).  In addition, it enables the modeler to follow best graphical practices (by providing an xgx theme that reduces chart ink, and by providing time-scale, log-scale, and reverse-log-transform-scale functions for more readable axes).  Finally, it provides some data checking and summarizing functions for rapidly exploring a PKPD dataset.

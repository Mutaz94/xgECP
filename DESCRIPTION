Description: The xgx R package supports a structured approach
    for exploring PKPD data (https://opensource.nibr.com/xgx). It also
    contains helper functions for enabling the modeler to follow best R
    practices (by appending the program name, figure name location, and
    draft status to each plot). In addition, it enables the modeler to
    follow best graphical practices (by providing an xgx theme that
    reduces chart ink, and by providing time-scale, log-scale, and
    reverse-log-transform-scale functions for more readable axes).
    Finally, it provides some data checking and summarizing functions for
    rapidly exploring a PKPD dataset.
